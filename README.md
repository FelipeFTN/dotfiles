# Configs & DotFiles 🗂️
Just a personal repository to save some configuration files.
I created a simple Bash script that handles all the boring installation part for me. 😵
You can run it by running ```sh install.sh```. _don't forget the sudo privileges._

## Neovim 🤓
This is my NeoVim config builded in Lua.<br>
You need to install [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage the third-part plugins.<br>
Just need a **symlink** to _~/.config/nvim_ and run ```:PackerSync``` to install all dependencies.

## Grub 🧠
Just a backup of my personal _/boot/grub/themes_ folder which saves a lot of searching for good themes for my [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).

## Alacritty
Where I save some themes and configuration for my terminal emulator.
